It's until death do us part. Then come eternal rewards or regrets depending on how we spent our lives. In his latest book, Francis Chan joins together with his wife Lisa to address the question many couples wonder at the altar: How do I have a healthy marriage? Setting aside typical topics on marriage, Francis and Lisa dive into Scripture to understand what it means to have a relationship that satisfies the deepest parts of our souls. In the same way <i>Crazy Love</i> changed the way we saw our personal relationship with God, <i>You and Me Forever: Marriage in Light of Eternity</i> will radically shift the way we see one of the most important relationships in our life. Jesus was right. We have it all backwards. The way to have a great marriage is by not focusing on marriage. Whether you are single, dating or married, <i>You and Me Forever</i> will help you discover the adventure that you were made for and learn how to thrive in it. 100% of the net profits from <i>You and Me Forever: Marriage in Light of Eternity</i> will go towards providing food, shelter and rehabilitation for thousands of orphaned children and exploited women in partnership with global charities."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1362751"],"name":["Francis Chan"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1294204210p5/1362751.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1294204210p2/1362751.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1362751.Francis_Chan"],"average_rating":["4.14"],"ratings_count":["150648"],"text_reviews_count":["5717"]}]}],"published":["2014"]},{"id":[{"_":"13789093","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["080101459X"],"isbn13":["9780801014598"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"130","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Art of Neighboring: Building Genuine Relationships Right Outside Your Door"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1340808128m/13789093.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1340808128s/13789093.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13789093-the-art-of-neighboring"],"num_pages":[""],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.77"],"ratings_count":["904"],"description":["What if Jesus meant that we should love our actual neighbors?<br /><br />When Jesus was asked to sum up everything into one command, he said to love God with everything we have and to love our neighbors as ourselves.
