But marriages can and will not only survive but thrive when husbands and wives learn to cherish one another.”<br /><br />Those are the powerful words of bestselling author Gary Thomas in his newest book—Cherish. And in a world desperate for marriage redemption, it is needed now more than ever.<br /><br />Thomas shows that although there are a countless number of marriages consisting of two people just going through the motions, there are real ways this pattern can be reversed: when husbands and wives learn to cherish one another in proven, loving, and everyday actions and words.<br /><br />Through personal stories and real world examples, Thomas proves what husbands and wives can begin doing today to turn their marriage around—even a marriage marred by neglect and disrespect.<br /><br />So how do you cherish your spouse? Thomas will show you how going out of your way to notice them, appreciate them, honor them, encourage them, and hold them close to your heart will bring hope, light, and life into your marriage."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["31970"],"name":["Gary L.

Almost all accounts of D Day are told from the Allied perspective. But what was it like to be a German soldier in the bunkers of the Normandy coast, facing the onslaught of the mightiest invasion in history? What motivated the German defenders, what were their thought processes - and how did they fight from one strong point to another, among the dunes and fields, on that first cataclysmic day? This book sheds fascinating light on these questions, bringing together statements made by German survivors after the war, when time had allowed them to reflect on their state of mind, their actions and their choices of June 6th. We see a perspective of D Day which deserves to be added to the historical record, in which ordinary German troops struggled to make sense of what was facing them, and emerged stunned at the weaponry and sheer determination of the Allied troops. Above all, we now have the unheard human voices of the individual German soldiers - the men who are so often portrayed as a faceless mass."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["13772517"],"name":["Holger Eckhertz"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13772517.Holger_Eckhertz"],"average_rating":["4.13"],"ratings_count":["4692"],"text_reviews_count":["248"]}]}],"published":[""]}]
